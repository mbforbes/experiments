# experiments

A repo where I keep my code snippets to test little things out in various languages.

## Usage
It's likely there's nothing useful in here, but if you see something you want to use, please just ask and I'll likely release it under the MIT license or public domain.

On occasion, files will be copied/generated from other sources. In that case, the files are owned / copyrighted by their respective owners, and their licenses apply.

I'm keeping the default license (for all files that I write) 'all rights reserved' for the sole reason that I have no idea what I'm going to put in here and don't want to worry about it harming others' computers.

Needless to say, if you do decide to forgo this and try something you see here, do so at your own risk; it might do anything!
